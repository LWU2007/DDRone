Currently focusing on hardware research:
-	Mostly includes hardware related to AI Acceleration and Scaling, using sources from third party news sources and major manufacturers like Nvidia. 
-	Deep dives into the inner workings of GPU components, for example memory types in GPUs like HMB, GDDR, VRAM.
-	Major difference between how a CPU and GPU process information.
-	General information about how a computer hardware works and its components

Future Plans
-	Slowly Learn how to code in C Language, as it wont just be used in CS&AI classes but also in the computer programming class
-	Study more about the history of AI and how the AI boom of the 2020s came to be
-	More details about how the biggest player in the AI boom, Nvidia was formed
-	General history of the development of the GPU and the companies and people involved in it
