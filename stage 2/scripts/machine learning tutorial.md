大家好, 我叫钟宝源。I am from team DDRone and I am going to show you a small demonstration on how you can make your own small machine learning project right at home.

All you have to do is open this website called "machine learning for kids" and you're all set. No need to download some shady applications from some sketchy website on the internet.

Once you're inside the website, you can start off with creating a new project.
Then fill in the project name, project type, and where you're going to store this project data to.

Once you've finished with filling those, you could just save and start training your "ai".

You first need to create a label for your words or data. In my example right here, I will be writing "nice words" and "bad words".

Then you can just fill in examples or in more scientific terms, training data. And once you're done with that, you can just press back to project and now press make to create your own interface to interact with your newly trained ai.

You can then open the scratch 3 website for ease of explanation and use. And you can then start creating your own code.

Once you've finished making your own code, you can start the project and see how it runs. Mine should work first try since I've already stressed about trying to fix my previous attempt for an hour more.
