25/10/2025
spend an hour and a half trying to fix whatevers wrong with either github or my connection, because fetching seems to come to a complete halt at 8% no matter what i do, and even trying to clone another repository stops at 63% (because why would it work as intended). currently still havent found a fix yet but im uploading all this via the github website. I hate my computer.
