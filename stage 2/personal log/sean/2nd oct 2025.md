I was brainstorming on how I’ll get research done; Conclude that I should gather information online first, then write it all down on a google document (obvious, but the method on how to do that had to be considered)

Decide next on where research should be concluded (ie, what sources to use, where good information can be found). Conclude that this will be obtained from a number of places, roughly in this particular order:
Look at the group, Mindware’s, research plan and what areas they covered. 
Look at their study guide to gain surface level understanding of Networks and possibly Hardware (focus being on networks of course)
Jot down notes on networks from the study guide, and also make a note, mental or on this document, what areas I believe are worth delving deeper into
Just use google, youtube or Chatgpt for more info on said areas that need deeper inquiry
Read first, then write down anything of note
Progress report with team on Monday, and then share notes with them once school restarts

1:21 pm - So far read up to hardware, but stopped and went to networks after hardware proved too lengthy, even for a surface level read

1:22 pm - stopped at page 54, pick up on it next time
