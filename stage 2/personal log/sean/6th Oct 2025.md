3pm Tokyo time - Had a meeting with group, discussed how we would approach stage 2 of the group project (ie, how the research would be compiled, whether we would rather give a presentation in class or make a video documenting our research)
Learnt how to use github repo from VScode
concluded that personal logs needed to be completed by tomorrow, and that:
1. data collection
2. ppt creation
3. video
4. study guide
5. Lexue
need to all be completed

Sent a summary of my logs to Keke (I had my logs on a google document, which is why I didn't have anything here until the 8th)

note for anyone reading: If I do get switched to the Chinese language class, I'll still work on the project, however if I'm not mistaken, there's one guy called emmanuel who still has no group. Should I not be able to handle all of the responsibilities, then you can replace me with this guy
