In reinforcement learning, there are 5 concepts that we have to understand before we dig any deeper into this subject.

First and foremost, we have the agent; it is the one who learns and decides on how to interact with the environment to achieve a certain goal. Its main purpose is to pick the best moves to achieve the highest reward.

Second is the environment; it is the world that the agent operates in. It defines the context, rules, and feedback mechanism for the agent's learning purposes.

Third one is the state; a state is the situation or condition the agent is currently in.

After that is the action; it is a decision made by the agent to interact and or influence the environment.

Lastly is the reward loop; it is a continuous cycle where the agent learns the optimal route through trial and error by receiving feedback from the environment.
