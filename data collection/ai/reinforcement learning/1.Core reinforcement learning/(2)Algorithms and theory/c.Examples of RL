We're finally done with the fundementals of reinforcement learning, now is time to see some examples of this ai used in real-world applications.

1. Simulated Starship Landing: While SpaceX uses traditional and highly control methods for its operational rocket landings like the Falcon 9, numerous deep RL projects have been conducted to test the vertical landing of the Starship.
2. OpenAI Five: A team of five coordinated RL agents trained to play DOTA2. It once beat a world champion team (OG) 2-0 in 2019.
3. Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta: uses Deep RL in simulations which is specifically for the challenging sequential decision-making tasks such as navigation intersections and handling unexpected events.
4. Stockfish: While not technically fully an RL ai, it's a hybrid of classical Alpha-Beta Search and Neural Network Evaluation. This is the most widely used chess-engine in the world, even used by the likes of Magnus Carlson, Fabiano Caruana, Gukesh Dommaraju (reigning world champion), and 丁立人 (previous world champion).
