Behavioral Modeling and Multi-Agent Systems applies advanced RL techniques to study and create realistic digital behaviors, from predicting individual choices to managing large-scale interactions between numerous AI agents. This is key for simulations, economic modeling, and coordinating swarms of robotic systems.


1. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) for Behavioral Cloning
- Focus: instead of giving a reward function a learning a policy, the agent is given expert human demonstrations and attempts to understand the reward function that motivated this behavior.
- Goal: To develop a scalable, generalizable learning policy that can learn a single and unifying reward function from diverse human demonstrations.


2. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and Coordination
- Focus: Involving multiple independent ai agents learning to interact within a shaerd environment. This is the foundation for managing complex systems such as traffic control, warehouse robotics, and the financial markets.
- Goal: Researching frameworks for a secure and robust collaboration. This involves all the agents sharing information but acting independetly in the real world.
