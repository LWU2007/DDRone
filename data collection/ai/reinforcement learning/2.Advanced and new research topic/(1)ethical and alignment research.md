The basics of Reinforcement Learning is finally over, now it's time to focus on the intersection of RL with the project's ethical and behavioral components.

First up is the ethical alignment research which focuses on transparency and accountability. This area directly adresses the "ethical consideration" and "ensuring transparency and accountability in ai".


1. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Alignment:
- Focus: Using human preferences to train a reward model that aligns the AI's behavior with human values, this is key for social media algorithms and LLMs.
- Advanced Goal: Developing RLHF frameworks that can extract more information from less human interactions


2. Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL):
- Focus: Breaking open the "black-box" nature of Deep RL to generate human-understandable explanations for the agent's decision and actions.
- Advanced Goal: Researching methods like policy summarization and visualization to determine if a neural network is making decisions as expected, thus adressing accountability.
