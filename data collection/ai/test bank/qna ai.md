tf questions:

- Is MDP derived from the Markov Chain?
- Online reinforcement learning is more useful than offline to train driverless vehicles.
- One of the use cases for reinforcement learning is to train cars to drive on their own
- In offline reinforcement learning, the ai can interact with the environment while training.
- MDP is defined by a state, action, transition probability, reward function, and discount factor.
- We can freely use ai without any consequences.
- One of the core fundementals of reinforcement learning is the agent itself.



multiple choice questions:

- Which is not the basic fundementals of reinforcement learning?
+ agent
+ environment
+ state
+ punishment

- The key elements of reinforcement learning is
+ policy
+ reward signal
+ model
+ agent

- Where is the Markov Delivery Process derived from?
+ Markov's rule
+ Pizza hut delivery
+ Stein's delivery process
+ Markov chain

- This is part of the Markov Chain
+ agent
+ punishment
+ reward
+ state

- What is an agent in reinforcement learning?
+ person who acts on your behalf
+ a person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect
+ a platypus in disguise
+ the one who learns and decides on how to interact with the environment to achieve a certain goal

- what makes online reinforcement learning different that offline?
+ it continuously adapts
+ data always matches with the current policy
+ it can interact with the environment while training
+ it is cheaper than offline reinforcement learning



open ended questions

- is online or offline reinforcement learning the better option in training your machine learning project?
- explain how the Markov Delivery Chain is connected to the Markov Chain! (optional: explain why they use the Markov Chain instead of any other probability processes such as the Possion Process)
