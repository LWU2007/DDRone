Moving on to unsupervised learning. This method of learning, unlike supervised learning, does not require any form of labeled data or human researcher to nurture. It trains on unlabeled data to find and discover hidden patterns, form clusters, or just simplify data amongst the chaos of the sea of data thrown at it. 

This method of machine learning, because it doesnt require labeled data, is very much more cost-friendly than supervised learning

Unsupervised learning has 3 main purposes: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction and Association Rule Mining. Clustering is like grouping certain pools of data together (similar to clustering customers of similar age groups or location).
Dimensionality Reduction is essentially squishing down the data to make a denser, and lighter block of information. It reduces the number of variables in the data while preserving as much as it can of the important bits. This method is often used at the pre-processing data stage.
Association Rule Mining is when the agent looks for relationships between the variables of the data, similar to how certain businesses can see what products are often grouped with other products.
