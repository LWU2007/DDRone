In reinforced learning, there are 5 concepts that we have to understand before we dig any deeper into this subject.

First and foremost, we have the agent; it is the learner and decision maker that interacts with the environment to achieve a specific goal. Its main purpose is to pick the best moves to achieve the highest reward.

Second is the environment; it is everything that surrounds and interacts with the agent. It defines the context, rules, and feedback mechanism for the agent's learning purposes.

Third one is the state; a state is a complete description of the environment at a specific point in time. It is basically a snapshot of the environment's configuration that helps the agent to make an informed decision on what it can do next and what immediate reward it can recieve.

After that is the action; it is a decision made by the agent to interact and or influence the environment.

Lastly is the reward loop; it is a continuous cycle where the agent learns the optimal route through trial and error by receiving feedback in the form of a scalar reward signal.
