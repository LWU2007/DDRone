In Machine Learning, there are 3 main types of learning: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and Reinforced Learning. They all have their own points and purposes so lets go through the first two quickly. 

The first is Supervised Learning. This method is done by feeding the agent 'Labeled Data', or we can think of them as questions WITH answers. This is usually done by a human researcher labeling the data and feeding it to the agent in order to train it to recognize patterns, generalizing them and then make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

This method of machine learning is usually more costly, as it requires large amounts of data to be prepared as well as someone to go through it all and label it.

Supervised learning is mainly used for 2 purposes: Classification and Regression. To put simply, classification is to sort the data between two distinct opposites (such as spam or not spam), while regression is for continuous values such as price and probability (eg. linear regressions and logistic regression)
