Good evening, my name is Lance, I am the CTO of DDROne and today I will be your presenter for hardware. Now let's get straight into it.

“Why does hardware in AI matter so much?
Hardware is the very thing that makes AI possible in the first place, it runs the complex computations required to make computers more like the human brain.

- Page 6:

AI hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that are specially designed or optimized to run artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. 

To put it simply, it makes everything that we have now, like ChatGPT and Deepseek possible

CPU: Central Processing Unit The Brain of the computer, controls all other components. Its main strength is its flexibility to handle all types of operations. 

GPU: Graphical Processing Unit The Muscle of the computer, incredibly quick with parallel computations which are heavily involved with AI workloads

These are the two most often seen types of processors in household computers to massive servers used by big companies

Here you can see a RTX 3090 on the right and an Intel Core Ultra 7 on the left. The 3090 is a few generations behind but still a very relevant GPU in terms of technology. Whereas the Intel CPU represents its latest generation of processors

TPU: Tensor Processing Unit 
The TPU is a custom built processor from Google designed specifically to work with neural networks and other tensor-heavy operations. They are incredibly fast with tensor calculations.

NPU: Neural Processing Unit
Often found in mobile devices like smartphones. They mainly focus on supporting AI operations, especially in inference. This is because they have great power efficiency making them ideal for such use cases

On the left you can see the latest generation of Google TPU, the Ironwood Accelerator. It is incredibly fast with tensor maths. On the right is the Apple M1
