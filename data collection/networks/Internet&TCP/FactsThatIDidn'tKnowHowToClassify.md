Telnet
FTP and SMTP serve specific internet functions, although tasks like programming on a university lab computer requires general purpose client server solutions, rather than a specific program for each task. Thus, TELNET (TErminaL NETwork) allows this through remote login, letting a user connect to a remote system and use it as if they were logged in locally. 

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
This refers to a client-server protocol used for accessing and transferring documents on the web, hypertext documents in particular. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested content or other information, structured in letter-like messages. 
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is an internet addressing standard used by HTTP to locate information online. A URL specifies four elements: the method, the host, the port and the path. 

A URL specifies an internet address using four parts:
Method HTTP for transferring documents
Host where information is stored, often with “www” as an alias
Port server port number, optional
Path file location, using slashes for directories

World Wide Web (WWW)
The WWW is a system of distributed information where individuals or organisations store information on their own computers, allowing others to access said information through the internet. The Web is a vast collection of multimedia documents

The WWW uses hypertext, which includes links in text, words, or phrases that connect to other document or media like images, videos etc. each hypertext document is called a “page”, with the main page for an organisation or individual known as a home page. 

A browser is needed to access pages on the Web and typically has three components:
A controller to manage activities, a method, usually HTTP, which retrieves documents, and an interpreter, which displays the document on the screen.

There are also 3 types of internet documents:
Static documents: have fixed content created on the server, which can only be copied. These are formatted with HTML
Dynamic documents: These are server-side programs that generate content in response to a browser request. The program runs on the server, and only the output is sent to the browser.
Active documents: These programs are transferred to the browser to be run locally, essential for tasks like running animations or games. These are often written in Java and require a Java interpreter on the browser (such as ruffle).
