Physics and data link layer
At the physical and data-link layers, TCP/IP does not define any specific protocol. It supports all of the standard and proprietary protocols. 

Network layer
In TCP/IP, the internet protocol, or IP, operates as an unreliable, best-effort delivery service, meaning it lacks error checking and tracking. Data units, called IP datagrams, are independent packets that can travel different routes to their destination and may arrive out of sequence or duplicated. IP does not track routes or reorder datagrams upon arrival

Addressing
Each computer on the internet must have a unique IP address, or internet address, which is 32 bits (4 bytes) long. For readability, IP addresses are written in dotted-decimal notation, separating each byte with a decimal point.

Application layer
The application layer combines the functions of the OSI modelâ€™s session, presentation, and application layers. Internet communication follows a client-server model, where a client program on a local machine requests services from a server program on a remote machine. Typically, the server is always active, while the client runs as needed.
