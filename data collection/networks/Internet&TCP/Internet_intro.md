The internet is an example of a link between multiple networks to form an internetwork. This means that individual LANs, MANs and WANs can be connected to form a network of networks. The internet now connects millions of computers worldwide, and does so using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite. This predates and doesnâ€™t fully align with the OSI model.
