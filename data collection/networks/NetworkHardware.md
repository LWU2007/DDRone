Networking hardware are the physical devices needed to connect multiple computers together in order to transfer data across either computer, either by wire, such as HDMI cables, or by wireless signals such as WIFI. The hardware that either receives the data last or generates data is known as the “host”, “end system” or “data terminal equipment”. This topic is very expansive and covers a wide range of hardware, as such, this section mainly provides an overview and a few key examples.

The hardware used in network often operate with the OSI framework to transmit signals from one device to another. Below shows examples of such hardware. 

Core networks
Core network components interconnect other network devices. Some examples include:

Router - Well known as the device that connects devices to WiFi. Routers forward data packets between computer networks, and are responsible for routing traffic on the internet. A data packet is forwarded from one router to another across the Internetwork until it reaches its desired address. This works on OSI Layer 3

Switch - A multi-port device connecting devices together at either the same or different speed on a network. It uses packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device. Network switches forwards data only to one or more devices which need to receive it, rather than sending data through all of its ports. This works on OSI Layer 2

Bridge - A device connecting multiple network segments (network segments referring to IP’s and ethernet). This works on OSI Layers 1 and 2

Repeater - A device that extends the length of a network by "regenerating" the signal. Repeaters simplify signals from devices without recognising addresses. They operate on OSI Layer 1.

Gateways - A connecting device that functions as a protocol converter, which is a device that converts two different types of transmission,, enabling communication between two networks with different protocols across all OSI layers.

Border networks
Hardware and/or software components typically sitting on the connection point of different networks. Some examples include:

Multilayer switch - A switch that can switch on OSI layer 2, as well as provide extra functionality at higher layers

Bridge router - As the name suggests, this device can act as both a bridge and a router. The brouter routes packets for known protocols and forwards all other packets, as a bridge would. 

Hybrid networks
Hybrid networks can be found in the core of a network. Some examples include:

Firewall - Notorious for preventing us from accessing western social media. Firewall can actually come in the form of both hardware and software, it prevents the transmission of signals between certain networks. Generally used for security reasons, shielding trusted, secure networks from unsecure, and potentially harmful networks. 

Proxy Server - Computer network service that allows users to make indirect network connections with other network connections

Network Address Translator (NAT) - NAT for short, these are network services that converts internal network addresses to external ones, and vice versa. 

Hardware used to create networks have become increasingly popular in this day and age, with more and more countries installing 5G towers, as well as WiFi becoming an increasingly common sighting in small restaurants and shops alike. This is particularly true in China, as daily life has effectively integrated the use of software like Alipay or Hello bike, all of which require mobile data or WiFi to use.
