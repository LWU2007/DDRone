There are 3 types of networks, each different in their range, speed and performance:

LAN (Local Area Network)
Generally a private-owned network that connects devices in a specific location. Each device has its own unique address (Called the IP address), allowing data packets to be routed between sender and receiver devices. It enables resource sharing among connected computers and devices via a transmission medium, such as a cable
LAN is limited to a small geographic area, typically a building such as an office, a hotel or a campus
LANâ€™s typically have high data transfer speeds due to the short range as well as the small amount of users typically using it at once
A network within a school or office building, where devices such as computers or printers connect locally
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
This is for connecting over larger areas than LANs. They connect network devices such as switches and routers. MAN are usually set up by communication companies and are leased to organisations. MAN relies on services from a network provider, such as a telephone company, and allows individual computers or entire LANs to connect to a network.
A MAN typically covers a larger area than LANs due to the greater area, such as a city or a large campus
While generally slower than LANs, they still provide moderate data transfer speeds for devices
The network connecting various offices of a company across a city or a network that links several branches of a university
WAN (Wide Area Network)
WANs are built to connect individual computers across several thousand kilometers. These are operated by network providers, similar to MANs. They can be connected via a telephone line for instance.
WANs cover extremely large distances, connecting devices across countries, and potentially intercontinentally
WANs are typically the slowest compared to LANs and MANs due to the long distances and the complexity of the connections
The internet can be considered itself a WAN, connecting users and devices alike globally. A corporate WAN can connect company offices worldwide

All three serve their own purposes, and whose usefulness depends on the distances that devices need to be connected. LANs are useful for connecting devices between small distances, MANs for covering cities or regions, and WAN for connecting large, global areas.
