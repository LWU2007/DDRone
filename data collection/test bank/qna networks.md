c. Bluetooth, radio waves and Telephone lines
d. Microwaves, visible light, gamma rays

Answer: A

4. What is the primary function of a LAN (Local Area Network)?

a) To connect devices over large geographic areas like cities or countries
b) To connect devices within a small geographic area, such as an office or school
c) To connect different types of networks such as LANs, MANs, and WANs
d) To ensure reliable end-to-end data delivery across networks

Answer: b

5. Which of the following devices operates at the physical and data-link layers of the OSI model?

a) Router
b) Gateway
c) Repeater
d) Bridge

Answer: d

6. In the context of the TCP/IP model, what does the Internet Protocol (IP) provide?

a) Reliable, error-free delivery of data packets
b) The logical addressing for routing data across networks
c) A method for encrypting data before transmission
d) A direct connection between two networks

Answer: b

7. What is the function of HTTP in the context of the World Wide Web (WWW)?

a) It encrypts documents before transferring them across the internet
b) It is used to send email messages between servers
c) It is a protocol used for transferring hypertext documents on the web
d) It allows remote login to a server for general-purpose computing tasks

Answer: c


1. A WAN (Wide Area Network) typically provides the fastest data transfer speeds due to its extensive infrastructure.
False
(WANs are usually the slowest due to long distances and complex routing.)

2. The Presentation Layer of the OSI model is responsible for translating data formats and handling encryption and decryption.
True

3. Repeaters operate at all layers of the OSI model to regenerate and redirect data.
False
(Repeaters operate only at the Physical Layer.)

4. In TCP/IP, the IP protocol does not guarantee reliable delivery or correct ordering of packets.
True

5. A Bridge can connect completely different networks using different protocols.
False
(That's the function of a Gateway. A bridge connects segments of the same type of network.)

6. The World Wide Web and the Internet are the same thing and can be used interchangeably.
False
(The Web is a service that runs on the Internet, but the Internet includes many other services too, like email, FTP, etc.)

7. Telnet allows users to remotely log in to another computer as if they were using it locally.
True

1. Explain three differences between LAN, MAN, and WAN. (3 marks)

- LAN covers a small area like an office or school, MAN covers a city or region, WAN covers large areas like countries or continents.
- LAN has the highest data transfer speeds, MAN has moderate speeds, WAN typically has the slowest.
- LAN is usually privately owned, MAN is often provided by telecom companies, and WAN is managed by large network providers or ISPs.

2. Describe three functions of the OSI Transport Layer. (3 marks)

- Breaks messages into packets for transmission.
- Ensures packets are delivered in the correct order.
- Handles error detection and retransmission of lost packets.
